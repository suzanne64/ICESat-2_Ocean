## ICESat-2_Ocean

ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) is a polar-orbiting satellite which measures elevation over the entire globe. This page discusses the three products involving ocean elevation. 

The ATL12 data set, available at https://nsidc.org/data/atl12, contains along-track sea surface heights at variable length scales over cloud-free regions. Estimates of height distributions, significant wave height, sea surface bias and 10-m heights are also provided. The data were acquired by the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) instrument on board the satellite.

The ATL19 data set, available at https://nsidc.org/data/atl19, contains monthly gridded dynamic ocean topography (DOT), derived from along-track ATLAS/ICESat-2 L3A Ocean Surface Height product (ATL12, above). Monthly gridded sea surface height (SSH) can be calculated by adding the mean DOT and the weighted average geoid height also provided in this data set. Both single beam and all-beam gridded averages are available in this data set. Single beam averages are useful to identify biases among the beams and the all-beam averages are advised to use for physical oceanography. The ocean is divided up into three regions: middle latitudes, north polar and south polar.

The ATL23 data set, coming soon, will contain 3-month gridded fields similar to those in ATL19, but for all-beam only. The grids are availble using simple averages of the data in each bin, as well as degree-of-freedom weighted averages.
