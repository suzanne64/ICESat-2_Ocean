## ICESat-2_Ocean

ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) is a polar-orbiting satellite which measures elevation over the entire globe. This page discusses the three products involving ocean elevation.

The ATL12 data set, available at https://nsidc.org/data/atl12, contains along-track sea surface heights at variable length scales over cloud-free regions. Estimates of height distributions, significant wave height, sea surface bias and 10-m heights are also provided. The data were acquired by the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) instrument on board the satellite.

The ATL19 data set, available at https://nsidc.org/data/atl19, contains monthly gridded dynamic ocean topography (DOT), grid-averaged in mid-latitude, north-polar, and south-polar grids. The input data comes from along-track ATLAS/ICESat-2 L3A Ocean Surface Height product (ATL12, above). Monthly gridded sea surface height (SSH) can also be calculated by adding the mean DOT and the weighted average geoid height provided in this data set. Both single beam and all-beam gridded averages are available in this data set. Single beam averages are useful to identify biases among the beams, and the all-beam averages are advised for use in physical oceanography. Simple averages, degree-of-freedom weighted averages and averages interpolated to the center of grid cells are included as well as uncertainty estimates.

The ATL23 data set, coming soon, will contain 3-month gridded fields similar to those in ATL19, but for all-beam only. The grids are availble using simple averages of the data in each bin, as well as degree-of-freedom weighted averages. Uncertainty weighted averages will be available in the future.
